### Overview  
This space is dedicated to showcasing my hands-on experience with sql through a collection of queries (basic to advanced queries), case-based exercises, data exploration projects, and practice problems.
- Tools: MySQL

### Database Normalization
- Content: It includes, First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), and Third Normal Form (3NF).

### SQL Operation
- Content: The queries here ranges from basic to advanced sql queries such as join, union, window functions, subqueries e.t.c

### Addressing Maji Ndogo water crisis 
- Content: This project involved leveraging SQL on a 60,000-record database. Using sql functions and advanced techniques, key findings related to the Maji Ndogo water crisis were uncovered. There are four parts to this project, which includes; 
- Part 1: Explored the dataset, identified unique water sources, analysed visit patterns, and addressed pollution issues by correcting and updating data in the water quality table using sql operations.

- Part 2: Performed data cleaning, identified top-performing employees who completed the survey task. Explored the water source location, assessed the water crisis scope, utilized window functions for repair solutions, analysed queues to identify water collection points, and generated a pivot table summarizing the findings.

- Part 3: Generated an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), integrated the auditor report for analysis, and joined employee data to enhance the insights. Additionally, constructed a complex query to gain a deeper understanding of the crises.

- Part 4: Joined tables of interest, created views, and temporary tables to simplify analysis. Employed advanced sql operations to analyse and derive final insights, culminating in the generation of a summary report.

### Olympic Event Analysis
- Content: This project is a collection of sql queries and analytical insights focused on Olympic athlete event data. It explores various aspects such as athlete participation, medal distribution, country performance, and event trends using structured SQL queries.
